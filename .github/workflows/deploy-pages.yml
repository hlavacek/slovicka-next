name: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages

# Build the Next.js app, export static HTML, and publish the 'out' directory to GitHub Pages.
# Note: Next's `next export` only supports static-friendly pages. If your app uses dynamic
# server-only features or the App Router heavily, consider deploying to Vercel or another
# Node host instead. This workflow uses the official GitHub Pages actions.
